## Description:
Polarad is an image sharing website where users can share their images with other users. Users will be able to log in and upload their photos. Other users can view and "like" their photos. Posts can be searched via form in the nav bar. There is also a "follower" functionality to follow specific users' posts. (Similar to Instagram...but not quite!)
